The aim of this project is to create a calorie counting application.

* When my app was almost complete I Unintentionally uploaded some files and pictures from my c drive 
to my github repository. They were not related to the project,I couldn't remove them and didn't want them on github ,
 so i created a new repository and gradually pasted in my project making a new commit each time. 
 As a result all my commits are done in the space of 1 days,there is only 15 commits and it doesnt say that it is forked from Ians ionoc-project. *
 
 The app is based on the side menu app and uses elements of the roll the dice app we created in class.
 
To food groups are listed on the side , to use the app click on a food you have consumed, the values *Per 100gramms * will be added to the total counter. the clear the values stored press the reset button.
