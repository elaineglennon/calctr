The aim of this project is to create a calorie counting application.

* When my app was almost complete I Unintentionally uploaded some files and pictures from my c drive 
to my github repository. They were not related to the project,I couldn't remove them and didn't want them on github ,
 so i created a new repository and gradually pasted in my project making a new commit each time. 
 As a result all my commits are done in the space of 1 days,there is only 15 commits and it doesnt say that it is forked from Ians ionoc-project. *
 
 The app is based on the side menu app and uses elements of the roll the dice app we created in class.
 
To food groups are listed on the side , to use the app click on a food you have consumed, the values *Per 100gramms * will be added to the total counter. 
 to clear the values stored press the reset button.
 
 The app can sometimes be slow to add the values , it sometimes gives a Nan error however when you select the same  item again it works perfectly. 
usuing weblinks for images may make it faster. the max calorie intake is 4000and the app wont allow you to add a item if it will exceed 400 however this value exceeds the daily requirement of most people.
